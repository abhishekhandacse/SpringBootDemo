**Spring Boot Initializer for REST api**
<br/>
Hi 
<br/>
I have made this simple spring boot repository while doing udemy course of **RESTful web services with Sping and Spring Boot by In28minutes**.
<br/>
While this is no doubt a  Hello World in spring boot world but still this can serve as a starting point if you want to build some restful api quickly without reinventing the wheel.
